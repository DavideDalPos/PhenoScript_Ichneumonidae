[Phenospy](https://pypi.org/project/phenospy/) is a Python package that facilitates the automatic analysis and comparison of ontology-based (= semantic) descriptions of species and phenotypes. Phenospy works with descriptions written in [Phenoscript](https://github.com/sergeitarasov/vscode-phenoscript), a computer language designed for describing species (support for other semantic approaches is under development). 

The Phenoscript language allows rapid coding of morphological and ecological traits using an individual-based approach (ontology's A-box). You can efficiently code Phenoscript by using the [VS Code Phenoscript extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=Tarasov-Lab.phenoscript) that provides syntax highlighting and snippet support. It can be installed from the Marketplace from within the VS Code. Its GitHub repository can be accessed [here](https://github.com/sergeitarasov/vscode-phenoscript). Afterward, Phenospy can be used to analyze and process the semantic descriptions.
