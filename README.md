# Phenospy (= Phenoscript Python tools)

Phenospy is a Python package that facilitates the automatic analysis and comparison of ontology-based (= semantic) descriptions of species and phenotypes. Phenospy works with descriptions written in Phenoscript, a computer language designed for describing species (support for other semantic approaches is under development). 

The Phenoscript language allows rapid coding of morphological and ecological traits using an individual-based approach (ontology's A-box). You can efficiently code Phenoscript by using the VS Code Phenoscript extension that provides syntax highlighting and snippet support. It can be installed from the Visual Studio Code Marketplace. Its GitHub repository can be accessed here. 

Afterward, Phenospy can be used to analyze and process the semantic descriptions.

## Install
Phenospy can be installed directly from the PyPI repository by running the following command in your terminal.

```{bash}
pip install phenospy
```

## Requirements

* Python >=3.0

If you are a new user with Python 2 installed, you should uninstall it and install Python 3 instead. For more information, please refer to [this discussion](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/3819449/how-to-uninstall-python-2-7-on-a-mac-os-x-10-6-4).
